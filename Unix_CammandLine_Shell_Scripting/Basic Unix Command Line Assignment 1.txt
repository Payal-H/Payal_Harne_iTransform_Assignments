Objective:- Assignments will help trainees to understand the basics of unix command and how to explore and use it.

DO NOT copy paste commands from internet, you can take help of the Unix in-built command manual.

Be Honest to yourself!

Important command and option to learn unix commands:-
man Command
Example:-
man ls

--help Option
Example:-
ls --help

NOTE:- Always use "man" command before using any unix commands and read about it and its options and how to use it.

Assignments:-

List the contents of a directory and their attributes
$ ls

Long list the content with file, directory ownership, permissions,sizes, etcâ€¦
$ ls -l

Display the size of the file in human readable format
$ ls -lh

Show all files and folders including hidden one
$ ls -A or $ls -a

list directories recursively
$ ls -R

Sort the files by size with largest at the top
$ ls -S

Sort the files by last time modified displaying the newest first.
$ls -lt

Diplay the location of a program/command, where it is installed.
$ whereis Program_Name

Which command is used to switch directory from one to another
$ cd path

List all the environment variables set for the current shell environment
$ printenv

Did you notice something in the output of "env" command?
- Yes, it print all the variable. If we want to print specified value then we will add attribute to the cammand.
EX : $printenv HOME

Which command is used to print the text or any variables value in the Console/Terminal?
$ echo

Print the value of the env variable "PATH" on the console
$ env:path

Is linux a case-sensitive operating system?
- Yes

Is, "Ls" same as "ls"?
- No, "Ls" and "ls" are the same and Is is no command

Display your currently logged in user
$ who

how do you change the currrently logged in user to another user?
$ su [options] [username [arguments]]
EX : su –l [other_user]

Which command is used to leave a shell environment that you are currently logged in to?
$ exit

How do you reboot the system?
$ sudo systemctl start reboot.target

How do you shutdown the system?
$ shutdown [OPTIONS] [TIME] [MESSAGE]
EX : $ sudo shutdown

Display all the major running processes in the system
$ ps
      PID    PPID    PGID     WINPID   TTY         UID    STIME COMMAND

Understand the output of command used in above question of displaying processes, explain the meaning of each column and what data it displays?
- PIDs - The process ID. Usually, when running the ps command, the most important information the user is looking for is the process PID. Knowing the PID allows you to kill a malfunctioning process .
-WINPID - This id shows the windows process unique number.
-TTY - The name of the controlling terminal for the process.
-STIME - The cumulative CPU time of the process, shown in minutes and seconds.
-Cammand - The name of the command that was used to start the process.

Display the name of the system kernel
$ uname  

display the kernel release number
$ cat /proc/version.

display teh machine type of the current kernel
$ uname –r

Display the name of the operating system that the kernel is running on
$ uname -srm

Display all info that uname command can show.
- uname shows the current os of system
EX : $ uname
	SunOS
	$ uname -a
	SunOS pluto 5.6 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5

Display the name of directory that you are currently pointing to
$ pwd

change the current directory to another directory that you have in your system.
$ cd

Go up one directory
$ cd ..

Return to last directory
$ cd ..

change the current directory to home(logged in user's) directory
$ cd home
$ cd user
$ cd dir_Name

How to check all the command used from the prompt (Command History)
- We using the up arrow and down arrow we can check all the previous cammand

In which file the history of commands are stored in?
$ echo $HISTFILE
/home/User/.bash_history


How many lines of history does the system keep and from where you can change it?
$ echo $HISTSIZE
 500
- The cammand is giving 500 as I am using the app in windows, The value may change system to sytem

How can you modify bash's history behaviour
$ export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace:ignoredups

Display all the commands entered so far, now, try to run a particular command from the history list without typing that command.
$ history
$ !n - !115 - to execute 115th cammand without typing the cammand

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)

What are the different types of shell and where are they used and how do we use them?

-In Unix, there are two major types of shells ?

Bourne shell ? If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the $ character is the default prompt.

C shell ? If you are using a C-type shell, the % character is the default prompt.

The Bourne Shell has the following subcategories ?

Bourne shell (sh)
Korn shell (ksh)
Bourne Again shell (bash)
POSIX shell (sh)
The different C-type shells follow ?

C shell (csh)
TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)
The original Unix shell was written in the mid-1970s by Stephen R. Bourne while he was at the AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey.

Bourne shell was the first shell to appear on Unix systems, thus it is referred to as "the shell".

What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?
-If you open a shell or terminal (or switch to one), and it asks you to log in (Username? Password?) before it gives you a prompt, it's a login shell.
-If it doesn't (like gnome-terminal), and lets you use it straight away, it's a non-login shell.

How do we start login shell and non-login shell?
-Shells in UNIX based systems can be started up in login and non-login modes: Login shell. A login shell is a shell given to a user upon login into their user account. This is initiated by using the -l or --login option, or placing a dash as the initial character of the command name, for example invoking bash as -bash


What happens when you start a login shell (which files are read and used and Why)?
-When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile,if that file exists. 
-After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. 

What happens when you start a non-login shell (Which files are read and used and Why)?
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force Bash to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.

So, typically, your ~/.bash_profile contains the line

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
after (or before) any login-specific initializations.

What are Shell Configuration Files, why do we need it?
- This file contains individual specific configurations. This file is read at login and also each time a new Bash shell is started. Ideally, this is where you should place any aliases.

Explain the Order of file usage from the system/user's home directory when user logs in to the System.
-A home directory is a file system directory on a multi-user operating system containing files for a given user of the system. 
-The specifics of the home directory (such as its name and location) are defined by the operating system involved; for example, Linux / BSD (FHS) systems use /home/<username> and Windows systems between 2000 and Server 2003 keep home directories in a folder called Documents and Settings.

What are Shell Variables, list major shell variables and what do they represent?
-A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly. Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables.

How we see all our env variables?
$ printenv

How we see all env variables in alphabical order?
$ get-childitem env:* |
> sort-object Key |
> more

What Format does the env var and its values are stored?

How do you create your own varible?

How do you start a new bash shell?

Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable

Making a variable accessible from other the shell in the system.

Show the real life use case of exporting a variable

Convert the above script file into a command, The file should run with "myappp" instead of "myapp.sh"

What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?

List all entries with extension ".sh"

List all entries with numbers in it.

List all entries that starts with a character and ends with a number

List all entries that name length more than 5 characters

What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?

Write few(minimum 3) unique examples that shows, how a particular problem is solved using Quoting.

How do you find a particular files/directories based on a particular search criteria?
HINT:- look for commands -> locate, find and whereis

Write major difference between locate, find and whereis?

How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?

Explain the Linux File System.

Explain absolute and Relative Paths

What are the different ways of creating a File in linux System? Write an example of each and the difference between them.

In how many ways we can delete the files from linux system? write an example of each and teh difference between them.
